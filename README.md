<h1 align="center">One Alarm</h1>

A small Android applications intended to help schedule one-shot alarms. You can shedule them using two modes:
- 'From now' - schedule alarms for example, 15 minutes from now. Pretty useful when you want to sleep for an hour.
- 'Exactly at' - schedule alarm exactly at 15:50 or something. 
If given time is before now, then alarm will be scheduled for the next day.

You can also specify "most-used alarms" in the preferences. They will appear on the home screen. Their mode is always 'From now'.
Besides, you can set some options like in system's alarm: snooze duration, silence after and volume button behaviour.
